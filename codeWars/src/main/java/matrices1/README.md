This is the first member of a series of three katas about matrices.

A matrix is a type of mathematical object that represents an array of elements (usually numbers) in a two-dimensional form. They are used in many fields of mathematics and computer science, for example to simplify the solution of linear equation systems or to represent transformations.

In this kata we will leave off the usage of matrices and just concentrate on the storage aspect of them.
Task

Your task is to implement a generic Matrix class that can hold a fixed amount of objects of any type. The class should contain a constructor that sets the dimensions of the matrix and methods to retrieve and manipulate the elements in the matrix.

The constructor accepts two parameters: one holds the number of rows, the other the number of columns in the matrix. The matrix should initially hold null values in every position.

The methods are the following:

- The get method retrieves the element in the matrix at position (i, j), where i and j are whole numbers that satisfy 1 <= i <= #rows and 1 <= j <= #columns.

- The set method replaces the element in the matrix at position (i, j) with a new value. The above criteria for i and j hold here as well.

- You should also provide a setRow method to enable the user to set the content of the i-th row in one statement. The parameters are i, the row's number and an array of elements of the appropriate size specified in the form of varargs (... in Java).

- The swap method swaps two elements in the matrix at specified positions (i1, j1) and (i2, j2) (so the method takes 4 arguments).

- Finally, the toArray method converts the elements in the matrix into a two-dimensional array of String-s, where each element in the array is the string representation of the element in the matrix at that position. toArray()[i][j] should return the element in the matrix at the intersection of the i + 1-th row and j + 1-th column.

In Java, the type Matrix should be a generic type with one type parameter describing the contained element. The methods set, get and setRow should all work with that type parameter.

You don't need to worry about the validity of method inputs: i and j will always be valid indices, and the array in setRow will always be as long as the number of columns in the matrix.

See the examples in the test cases.
