This is the second member of a series of three katas about matrices.

In the previous kata, we have familiarized ourselves with the basic concept of the matrix and wrote some methods for accessing and manipulating the elements of the matrix. Now we are going to focus on the operations we can perform on matrices. For now, we will stick onto matrices containing numbers though.
Task

Your task now is to implement the class Matrix, featuring several operations on matrices like adding and multiplying. The class should represent an immutable matrix object, meaning that neither its size nor its elements are subject to change.

The Matrix() constructor takes a two-dimensional array of numbers, which represents the structure of the matrix: the i-th element of the input array stores the elements in the i-th row of the matrix. Invalid array inputs (such as empty arrays, or arrays with sub-arrays of different lengths) should be properly handled, in the form of throwing an IllegalArgumentException when necessary.

You should also be able to create another constructor, taking two integers, the number of rows and columns in the matrix, and an only one-dimensional array (varargs) of double values representing the elements in the matrix, from left to right and top to bottom. (So if the matrix is of type m x n, then the first set of n values in the array are the elements in the first row of the matrix, the second set of n values represent the next row etc., up until the m-th set.) Also, don't forget to check for input validity.

The methods are the following:

- The transpose method returns a new Matrix object representing a matrix with the rows and columns of this matrix swapped.

- The add method takes another Matrix and returns a new one that is the sum of is this matrix and the one provided as the argument. The rules of matrix addition are the following: the sum of matrix A and matrix B is the matrix A + B, where every element of A + B is obtained by adding the corresponding values in the addends. The definition implies that matrix addition is only possible if the matrices A and B are of the same types (have the same number of rows and columns). If this not the case, throw an IllegalArgumentException.

- The multiply method has two overloads: one taking a number, the other taking a Matrix as an argument.

- The first method is for scalar multiplication, which simply multiplies every element of the matrix with the given number.

- The second one is more exciting. It is for matrix multiplication, which is defined as follows: the product of an m x n matrix A and an n x k matrix B is the m x k matrix AB, in which the element at a given (i, j) position is the scalar product of the i-th row of A and the j-th column of B. The scalar product of two vectors (matrices with one row or column) is the sum of the products of the corresponding elements (being at positions (i, k) and (k, j)).

- I also added a toArray method which you need to fill in, which returns the elements in the matrix in the form of a two-dimensional array of double values.

An example of matrix-matrix multiplication:

                   ( 9,  8,  7 )
                   ( 6,  5,  4 )
                   ( 3,  2,  1 )

    ( 1,  2,  3 )   (30, 24, 18)
    ( 4,  5,  6 )   (84, 69, 54)
    ( 7,  8,  9 )   (138,114,90)

where the top-left element (30) was obtained by the following computation: 30 = 1 * 9 + 2 * 6 + 3 * 3. If the above doesn't make sense, check matrix multiplication on wikipedia for example.

See the test cases for suggested usage.
